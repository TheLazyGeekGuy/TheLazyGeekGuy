## 👋 About Me

I'm **TheLazyGeekGuy**, and despite the nickname, I’ve been anything but lazy when it comes to **technology** and **music** for the last **30+ years**.  
My journey spans everything from punch cards to the cloud, from C to Rust, and from MIDI cables to modular synths.

I believe in solving problems once — and solving them well. That's where the *lazy* part comes in:  
I automate the boring stuff so I can focus on what truly matters — creating, optimizing, and remixing life one repo at a time.

## 💼 What I Do

- 🔧 **Architecture & Legacy Systems**: Still remember when servers were actual boxes in closets.
- ⚙️ **Automation & Scripting**: From shell-fu to Python hacks, I'm fluent in laziness.
- 🎛️ **Audio Nerding**: DSP, synth programming, Ableton wizardry, and occasional algorithmic composition.
- ☁️ **Modern Dev**: DevOps, containers, CI/CD, GitOps — if it ends with "Ops", I've touched it.
- 🎸 **Open Source & Indie Projects**: Because not everything needs to be closed or corporate.

## 🛠️ Tools of the Trade

```bash
Languages:   Bash | Python | JavaScript | C/C++ | Rust (new love)
Dev:         Docker | Git | Ansible | Linux (of course)
Music:       Pure Data | VCV Rack | Ableton | Reaper | Max/MSP
```

## 🎵 Side Hustle

When not hacking code, I'm hacking beats. Whether it's ambient drones, glitchy electro, or deep house grooves, music is my second terminal window.

Expect projects mixing:
- 💿 Code & Music
- 🧪 AI & Audio
- 📟 Retro tech & sound
